The user of this web app can select from 3 tools that converts measurements useful in the beer industry.

Julian Date Converter
The Julian converter is helpful for determining the expiration date on certain beer brands, such as Lagunitas and Natural Ice.  The first four digits of the printed number on the package represent the expiration date.  The day of the year is represented by a number between 1-365 and the year is represented by the last digit.  For example, 0011 would be January 1st, 2021.

ABV Converter
It is often misleading how many "drinks" of alcohol are in a given can or bottle of beer.  For example, a 12oz serving of 5% beer is 1 standard drink, while a 16oz serving of 7.5% beer is 2 full standard drinks.  This calculator allows you to keep track of how many standard alcoholic drinks you would imbibe with each serving of beer.

Volume Calculator
When purchasing beer, it is often confusing how many ounces you are getting per dollar.  Beer comes in many formats - 4 packs, 6 packs, 12 packs, as well as 12oz or 16oz cans or bottles.  This calculator allows you to determine a specific price per ounce on any format.
